M2 is a monetary aggregate that includes all physical currency circulating in the economy (banknotes and coins), operational deposits in central bank, money in current accounts, saving accounts, money market deposits and small certificates of deposit. Excess money supply growth potentially can cause inflation and generate fears that the government may tighten money growth by allowing the interest rates to rise which in turn, lowers future prices.

Firms are asked whether output, employment, orders, prices and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged over the previous month.

When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share of firms reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the prior month. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero,suggesting the indicator has decreased over the prior month.

Calculating the trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate for a given month involves looking at the price changes for each of the individual components of personal consumption expenditures. The individual price changes are sorted in ascending order from fell the most to rose the most, and a certain fraction of the most extreme observations at both ends of the spectrum are like a skaters best and worst marks thrown out, or trimmed. The inflation rate is then calculated as a weighted average of the remaining components. For the series presented here, 19.4 percent of the weight from the lower tail and 25.4 percent of the weight in the upper tail are trimmed. Those proportions have been chosen, based on historical data, to give the best fit between the trimmed-mean inflation rate and proxies for the true core PCE inflation rate.

The consumer price index is used as a measurement of inflation and is a key economic figure. Likely impact: 1) Interest Rates: Larger-than-expected quarterly increase in price inflation or increasing trend is considered inflationary; this will cause bond prices to drop and yields and interest rates to rise. 2) Stock Prices: Higher than expected price inflation is bearish on the stock market as higher inflation will lead to higher interest rates. 3) Exchange Rates: High inflation has an uncertain effect. It would lead to depreciation as higher prices mean lower competitiveness. Conversely, higher inflation causes higher interest rates and a tighter monetary policy that leads to an appreciation.",United Arab Emirates,AED

2133,Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Board’s Policy Setting Meeting Dates,"A monetary policy is generally the process through which a central bank with a sole right to issue its own currency (legal tender or monetary base) maintains the value of that currency, that is, price, and achieves sustainable economic growth by managing the amount of money (monetary base and money created in the banking system) in circulation, and price (interest rate) in the economy. Bank of Korea Act stipulates that the purpose of this Act is “to contribute to the sound development of the national economy by pursuing price stability through the formulation and implementation of efficient monetary policy”. Accordingly, the Bank of Korea takes price stability as the most important objective of its monetary policy. If prices become unstable, uncertainty concerning the future mounts, discouraging economic activities as a whole, and the distribution of income and resources grows distorted. As a result, the stabilityin economic conditions as a whole is damaged. In order for the national economy to achieve stable growth, it should be supported by not only price stability but also financial stability. Regarding this, Article 1, Clause 2 of the「Bank of Korea Act」 stipulates that “The Bank of Korea needs to pay attention to financial stability in the implementation of monetary policy”. Thus, the Bank of Korea is also making policy efforts to maintain financial stability while pursuing price stability through implementing its monetary policy.",South Korea,KRW
